Keycaps
=======

So finally, here you can find all of the keycap models I printed/designed. 

It's all WIP, so your results may vary. 

Feel free to modifiy or extend the repo!

The work is based on the models of kekstee ( https://github.com/kekstee/3dprint )
The emerald is from here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28377
The music symbols are also not mine, I do not remember where they're from, though (it's been a while)
